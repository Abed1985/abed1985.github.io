      <description>Solution Overview Definition &amp;amp; Overview Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is an advanced access control method that leverages client device identification, authentication, and Zero Trust tags to provide role-based access to applications. ZTNA enables administrators to manage network access for both on-fabric local users and off-fabric remote users. Access is granted only after a series of checks: device verification, user identity authentication, user authorization, and context-based posture checks, all using Zero Trust tags.</description>

While this convenience is beneficial, it also raises the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive organizational information. LLM models can incorporate leaked data into their training sets, potentially making it part of responses to external users—significantly increasing security risks.</description>
