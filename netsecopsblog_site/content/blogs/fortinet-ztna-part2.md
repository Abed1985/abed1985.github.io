In the second part of our Fortinet ZTNA series, we explore a practical use case involving remote access to basic on-premises data center resources.

The following high-level diagram illustrates the setup:

<br>
This scenario involves the need for remote access to four servers within the data center, each with different access requirements:
<br>
<br>

| Server IP     |           OS              | Service                 | ZTNA Server Access Proxy Type|
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| 192.168.5.100 | web server over linux     | Web access over TCP/443 | HTTPS Access Proxy           |
| 192.168.2.222 | web server over esxi host | Web access over TCP/443 | HTTPS Access Proxy           |
| 192.168.2.2   | Windows server            | RDP access over TCP/3389| TCP Forwarding Access Proxy  |
| 192.168.2.3   | Ubuntu                    | SSH access over TCP/22  | SSH Access Proxy             |



The configuration steps will involve both the FortiGate and FortiClient EMS devices. The following topics will be covered:

- Fortigate & FortiClient EMS connectivity. 
- Forticlient & FortiClient EMS connectivity.
- SAML Authentication with Azure as IdP and Fortigate as SP.
- ZTNA access proxy server types, use cases and their basic configuration.
- ZTNA certificate Management. 
- ZTNA Destinations configuration.
- ZTNA Rules configuration. 
- ZTNA Tags configuration. 

This part focuses on the connectivity between FortiGate/FortiClient EMS and FortiClient/FortiClient EMS.

FortiGate maintains a continuous connection to the EMS server, synchronizing endpoint information and ZTNA tags. 
This fabric connection plays a critical role in the solution's functionality and traffic flow.


## Fortigate & EMS Connectivity
- FortiGate uses the FortiClient EMS fabric connector to establish a connection with FortiClient EMS.
- For the fabric connection to work, FortiGate must verify the FortiClient EMS server's certificate. A CA certificate needs to be installed on FortiGate; otherwise, the certificate will not be trusted, causing the fabric connection to fail.
- FortiClient EMS must authorize FortiGate as a fabric device.

### Configuration

1. Export the FortiClient EMS SSL certificate and import it into FortiGate. The certificate is stored in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" folder on the FortiClient EMS server. A wildcard certificate can be used, imported as a remote certificate CA in FortiGate.

2. Add EMS as a fabric device on FortiGate. FortiClient EMS must authorize FortiGate as a fabric device. 
The fabric connection can connect directly to an EMS server or an EMS tenant. Each customer site/tenant in EMS must have a DNS A record pointing to FortiEMS for the fabric connection.

After logging into FortiClient EMS, a pop-up will prompt you to authorize FortiGate. Until authorized, the FortiClient EMS connector status will show "down."

Under Administration â†’ Fabric Devices, you will see the FortiGate authorized as a fabric device.

Once connected, FortiGate will automatically synchronize ZTNA tags from FortiClient EMS.

## Forticlient & FortiClient EMS Connectivity

- The FortiClient endpoint must establish a connection to FortiClient EMS.
- The telemetry connection between FortiClient and FortiClient EMS is a crucial dependency of the ZTNA solution. This step must be completed before moving on to further configurations (with the first step being the fabric connection between FortiGate and FortiClient EMS).
- The connection can be verified on the FortiClient console under the Zero Trust Telemetry menu or by navigating to Endpoints > All Endpoints in FortiClient EMS.
- FortiClient EMS listens for incoming connections from FortiClients on TCP/8013, so ensure inbound access to this port is allowed on the public network.
