      <description>In this blog post, we explore the foundational technologies that power AI/ML infrastructure—from training and inference clusters to the specialized networking required to keep GPU-driven workloads running smoothly. While we touch on some technical topics like RoCEv2, RDMA, and congestion control mechanisms (PFC, ECN), the goal is to provide a broad understanding for readers who are curious about how AI systems are built and scaled. You don’t need to be a deep technical expert to follow along, but a little networking or systems background will help you appreciate the complexities involved.</description>
